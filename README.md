### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm front-end web developer and music industry professional based in Athens, Georgia.

While my web experience dates back to the age of GeoCities, I've been building coding professionally for a little over a decade for clients and friends across industries.

In addition, for the last fifteen years I have been an active member of the local Athens music scene as an artist manager, digital marketer, recording engineer and ally of musicians and performers.
